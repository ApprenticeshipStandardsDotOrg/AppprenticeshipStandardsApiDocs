# Authentication

> Example authorization request:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<%= config[:endpoint] %>/occupations' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYmI1NjNlZWMtYTZmZi00MjZiLWFkNzUtNzNiM2IyZWM2MDA1IiwiYXBpX2tleV9pZCI6ImE1YWFmYzA0LTA1YmItNDVlMS04NDliLTEzOTlmMTNjNDg5OCJ9.EdwBMEPGBIZwarW1GTHzqpqus6rt8VsJZLM_cJgN8lE'
```

ApprenticeshipStandards uses API keys to allow access to the API. The API key
must be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like
the following:

`Authorization: Bearer your-api-token`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your-api-token</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

For readability, the headers will not be included in further examples.
